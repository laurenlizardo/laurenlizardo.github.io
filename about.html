                    <br>
                    <p class="about-text">Hi there! &#128075;&#127997;I'm a game developer based in the Pacific Northwest. I like to make things, from food to PC builds.</p>
                        
                    <p class="about-text">I have four years under my belt creating games and experiences for XR platforms. Since the beginning of my career, I have collaborated with startups and small studios on a variety of XR projects, from arcade games to quality assurance apps. Those works were created for platforms such as iOS, Android, HoloLens, and Oculus Quest.</p>
        
                    <p class="about-text">Although my professional career is based on developing for XR platforms, delivering memorable experiences through video games is my ultimate passion. I specialize in programming and have a deep interest in systems design.</p>
                    
                    <p class="about-text">Before the start of my career, I attended the Academy of Art University and earned my BFA in Game Development.</p></div>
